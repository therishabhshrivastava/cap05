        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
        <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
        <p>2H<sub>2</sub><span> + </span>O<sub>2</sub><span> â†’ </span>2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<em>H</em><sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (<em>O</em><sub>2</sub>) to form water (<em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>O</em>).</p>

        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
        <p><dfn>Stoichiometry</dfn> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
